I have been passionate about technologies especially low level stuff from very early on. During my school  I was interested on electronics and robotics and really loved tinkering with different hardware. I used to take apart  the hardware and reverse engineer them using datasheets to know how they really worked. 
Then when I really fell into programming during my high school days when I got my first Arduino Uno Board. After that I worked on several Electronics,Robotics and other micro-controller based projects.It really taught me inner workings of computers and other devices really well.
Then after joining  CS degree I got to know about computing and computational techniques from theoretical and mathematical perspective as well. Until then I was looking computing through electronics perspective ( i.e transistors,gates,microcontrollers etc) rather than computational perspective (  i.e finite automata,DSA,discrete math, Compiler theory etc.)
Now I am  on a journey to explore computation and computing from both theoretical and practical perspective and hope to work on solutions and problems in wide range of field of CS.
I am interested on systems level technologies rather than application development. I think I am more leaned towards dealing  with machine rather than designing interface for the end users.
