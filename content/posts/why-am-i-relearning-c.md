# Why am I (re) learning C

C is first language that I fell in love and still has special place in my heart. I had learnt C before I even had access to any computer. It felt so natural and
helped me to understand how computers work. I used it a lot while learning embedded systems programming using Arduino. But I never used it for writing anything requring deeper understanding
of computer systems. Then I moved to another high level languages like Javascript,Python,PHP etc.I always wanted to learn how computer systems works by writing low level programs. I tried learning C++ but it seems monstrous to learn. I had learnt C++ in college during OOP and DSA class but real world C++ is very different. Every project seems to use their own subset of C++ and toolbox of abstractions.Then there is complex build systems
like CMake which I didn't like at all.Though I may learn modern C++ in future if needed, I think C and Rust will suffice the needs for most systems programs that I want to write. </br>
Everything changed when I discovered rust language.I was looking into webassembly and got to know about this language.It looked very modern and had nice tooling.So I started learning it and understood the fundamentals but struggled to grasp advanced concepts. I realized that I had
serious gaps in understanding of low level programming.Most of the programmers using rust for systems programming and low level stuff seems to be coming from C/C++ world. Most of the existing concepts are implemented and taught in C/C++.So, I think It will be greatly beneficial to learn C properly and use it to learn 
low level concepts before using rust language. Though its not compulsory I found it hard to directly jump into rust world without proper understanding of C and its pitfalls.</br>So I am trying to re-learn C again and move into rust language once I become proficient in Systems programming in C. I also wanted learn to C also to understand C bindings used by rust libraries and contribute in migrating
unsafe c code into modern and safe rust programs. I am learning C using classic book called K&R book named after its authors Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie.
