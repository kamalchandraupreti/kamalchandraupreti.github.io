Hi I am recent Computer Science and IT (CSIT) graduate interested in Systems Programming and Embedded Systems as well as AI and Robotics. 

I am using C/C++ and Rust for low level stuff and Python/Bash for scripting and higher level stuff.

I want to work on deep CS stuff like operating systems,compilers and theoritical CS stuff as well as applying those knowledge to build autonomous robots.
