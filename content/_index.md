Hi I am recent Computer Science and IT (CSIT) graduate interested in Systems Programming and Embedded Systems as well AI and Robotics. 

I am using C/C++ and Rust for low level stuff and Python/Bash for scripting and higher level stuff.

I want to work on deep CS stuff like operating systems,compilers and theoritical CS stuff as well as applying those knowledge to build autonomous robots.

I am learning mathematics and python skills required for advanced robotics and AI ( especially Computer vision). I am also re-learning C language. I am planning to learn Rust and Modern C++ after learning C properly and using it for Systems programming.
