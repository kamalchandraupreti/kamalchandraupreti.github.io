Hello! I am Kamal and I am interested in Computers, Electronics, Robotics and Technology in general.
I am mostly learning about low level stuff like Operating Systems, Computer Architecture and Systems Programming these days. I had completed Bachelors in Computer Science and Information Technology (Bsc CSIT).
I am working on having solid computer science background so I am re-learning many stuff that I had gone through in CS classes as they were shallow and exam focused instead of understanding core concepts.

I learning these things currently:

* Systems Programming in C
* Computer architecture and Assembly Programming using RISC-V
* Linux kernel internals
* Understanding Custom Android ROMs and postmarketos based Linux booting
* Rust language and embedded rust using esp32c3 board
* Programming intro from CS theoritical viewpoint using SICP Book
